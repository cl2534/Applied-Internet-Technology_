#Notes on Testing for the Graders
1. Once in the root directory (zk377-homework06), run "npm install" which will install all necessary dependencies
2. In the same root directory, app.js (and db.js) resides, so all you need to do to test is run "node app.js"
3. home page is "http://localhost:8080/image-post"

(Joe stated it was not imperative to create a directory structure including a an image-board folder if everything works as is. It's probably easier this way as well)
